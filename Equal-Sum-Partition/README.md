# Problem: Equal Sum Partition

## Description

As the name would imply, the **equal sum partition** problem is a number partitioning problem. Given a set *S*, can the set be partitioned into two subsets with an equivalent sum.

## Example
If *S* = {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}, then the set can be partitioned into two subsets:
* *A* = {1, 5, 6} and
* *B* = {4, 8}

where both *A* and *B* sum to 12.
