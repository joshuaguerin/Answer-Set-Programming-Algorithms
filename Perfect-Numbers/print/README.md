# Perfect Numbers Printer

## Description
The printer takes input from standard input, and can be piped directly in from the program's output in Clingo.

## Arguments
There are no arguments, nor configurations necessary.

## Implementational Details
Distribution of perfect numbers is rather sparse--there are only 3 such numbers in the range [1..1000] (i.e., 6, 28, 496). For the sake of simplicity, printed results are hard-coded for the first 9 perfect numbers, which should well exceed what the program is capable of generating in a reasonable amount of time.
