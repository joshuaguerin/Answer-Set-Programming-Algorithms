# Problem: Perfect Numbers

## Description

A Perfect Number, **n**, is a positive integers where the divisors of **n** sum to **n**. In this case we restrict the divisors to only include those numbers less than **n**.

For example:
* 6 is a perfect number. 6 has divisors: {1, 2, 3} and 1+2+3 = 6.
* 28 is a perfect number. 28 has divisors: {1, 2, 4, 7, 14} and 1+2+4+7+14=28.

Perfect numbers are relatively sparse, with the first 5 being:
* 6, 28, 496, 8128, and 33550336.
