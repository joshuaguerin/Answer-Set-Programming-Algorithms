# Dominating Set Printers

## Description
The printer takes input from standard input, and can be piped directly in from the program's output in Clingo.

### Arguments
There is a single, (optional) parameter, `-f f`, where `f` is the file name.

Output generated by Clingo, in this instance, is insufficient for a representative graphic, so the original instance file is supplied (with a path if necessary). If omitted, the parameter defaults to "instance.lp" in the calling directory.
