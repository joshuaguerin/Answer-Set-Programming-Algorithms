# Answer Set Programming Algorithms

## Background
I have been a logic programming enthusiast for some time. My first experiences were during my undergrad years with Prolog in the early 2000's. My interest in the subject really began to grow during graduate school at the University of Kentucky where I received formal training in Answer Set Programming and other related topics in formal logic.

My goal for this repo is to bring together solutions/algorithms to classical problems in computer science in the Answer Set Programming dialect of [Clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/). Perhaps one day I will write a book on the subject, using this repo as a basis.

## Note about content
My goal is for the work to be the product of my own efforts to whatever extent possible, although natural similarities are likely to exist between my own sources and those written by others.

First, I've been influenced greatly over the course of my own studies by the educational resources provided by the good folks over at [Potassco](https://potassco.org/). I would consider many of their examples to be "the standard," and at this point. I would also have trouble *avoiding* the conventions I've learned from their code as they have been the basis of much of my own education and instruction. Any similarities to other sources are unintentional, and are likely motivated by similarities in training/reasoning about logic programming.

Second, ASP solutions to problems are typically much shorter than solutions in other conventional programming languages. One can come up with decent solutions to NP-Hard problems in <10 lines (sometimes <5) of actual code. We are most likely encoding similar ideas to solve the same problem. Variations on ordering of statements, choices of identifiers, and ways ideas are expressed are likely to exist, but otherwise outcomes may be strikingly similar.

## Bugs and other issues
Oh, yea, there will be bugs. It's going to be a while before I'm comforatble enough to label anything as being "done." Proceed with caution if you are using these for learning purposes.

I don't know if anyone will discover this repo, but if you do and you find a bug feel free to hit me up!

## Future updates
I'm mainly pushing this out for fun at the moment, but life is hectic. I have no idea how frequently I'll be able to update, or whether I'll forget about it entirely!
