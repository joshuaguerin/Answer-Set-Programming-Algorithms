# Answer Set Programming Algorithms

I have been a logic programming enthusiast for some time. My first experiences were during my undergrad years with Prolog in the early 2000's. My interest in the subject really began to grow during graduate school at the University of Kentucky where I received formal training in Answer Set Programming and other related topics in formal logic.

My goal for this repo is to bring together solutions/algorithms to classical problems in computer science in the Answer Set Programming dialect of [Clingo](https://potassco.org/). Perhaps one day I will write a book on the subject, using this repo as a basis.

My goal is for the work to be the product of my own efforts to whatever extent possible, although natural similarities are likely to exist between my own sources and those written by others. First, I've been influenced greatly over the course of my own studies by the educational resources provided by the good folks over at [Potassco](https://potassco.org/). I would consider many of their examples to be "the standard," and at this point I would have trouble *avoiding* the conventions I've learned from their code as they have been the basis of my own education and instruction.
