# I am my own Grandpa! Printer

## Description
The printer takes input from standard input, and can be piped directly in from the program's output in Clingo.

### Arguments
There are no arguments, nor configurations necessary.

### Output
Output is in [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) dot format. The structure should be human-parsable, however use of graphviz will result in improved, visual renderings. Output can be redirected into a `.dot` file or piped directly into the `dot` application.

Please see the printer's header documentation for example use.
