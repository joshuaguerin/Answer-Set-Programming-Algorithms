# K-Clique & Max-Clique Generators

## Generator Description
1. The generator takes in 2 (optional) command-line arguments, the number of nodes in the graph and the desired clique size.
2. The program generates a clique based of the appropriate size.
3. Each time a connection is made, the program randomly decides how many additional nodes to connect to that are not part of the clique.

The final step constructs additional vertices and edges around the clique. New or larger cliques may result from the process.
