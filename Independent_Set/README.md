# Problem: Independent Set

## Description

Given a graph *G=(V, E)*, and **independent set** (or **anticlique**) of the graph is a subset of vertices, *I*, such that no vertices in *I* are adjacent. Related problems are either finding an independed set of a particular size (a **K-Independent Set**), or the related optimization problem, finding the *maximal* independent set.
