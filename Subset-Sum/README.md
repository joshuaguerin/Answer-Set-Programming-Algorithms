# Problem: The Subset Sum Problem

The [Subset Sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem) problem is a standard NP-Hard problem in computing and number theory. Given a set of integers, *S*, and a target value *n*, is there a subset of *S* that sums to exactly *S*.

There are several variants of this problem that are NP-Hard. Some assumptions in this encoding are:
* A [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)) of values is encoded (vs. a [multiset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset)) because the encoding of values is a single predicate.
* Generating software is over positive integers (an arbitrary decision that should be easy to modify).
