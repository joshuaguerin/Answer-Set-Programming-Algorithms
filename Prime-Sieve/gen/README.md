# Prime-Sieve Generator

## Description
This problem does not contain an instance generator
due to the nature of the problem. We are filtering 
through all the possible numbers from 2 through n,
filtering for primes or composites. Since the user
provides this upper limit of n, no instance
generator is necessary.
