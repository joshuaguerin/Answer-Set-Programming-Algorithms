# Problem: Prime Sieve

## Description

A number is *prime* if it has no integer divisors other than 1 and itself.
* The first five *prime* numbers are: {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}.

A number is *composite* if it has integer divisors other than 1 and itself.
* The first five *composite* numbers are: {4, 6, 8, 9, 10}.


These categories are clearly mutually exclusive, and one can be defined by the other.
