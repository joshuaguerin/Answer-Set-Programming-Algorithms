# Problem: Bin Packing

## Description

The **Bin Packing** problem is an optimization problem. Given a set of items, $I$, where each item is associated with a label and a cost, *i<sub>x</sub> = (l, c)* (size, weight, etc.), and a max bin capacity, *c*, find the smallest number of bins that will fit all items without exceeding any bin's capacity.
